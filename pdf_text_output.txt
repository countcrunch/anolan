**IF HAULING A POWER ONLY LOAD ON A FREIGHTVANA TRAILER, PLEASE SEE BELOW**
        • 
FreightVana trailers cannot be railed.
        • 
Freightvana empty trailer returns must be completed in the following time frame: Transit time +24 hours. Failure to return in this           
period would incur a charge to the carrier of $100 per day.
        • 
If the FreightVana Inspection App is not used when picking and/or delivering a FreightVana trailer, then you (the carrier) will be               
responsible for any cost or replacements associated with the damage or loss to trailer while in your possession.  
        •
Any repair or costs to the trailer without authorization from FreightVana are not guaranteed to be reimbursed and you (the                       
carrier) may be responsible for any costs associated if repair was not sufficient.
        •
Flat Pay Rate is not final until the Freightvana trailer returns to the final destination on the rate confirmation.  A new rate                             
confirmation will be issued to the carrier in the event of a late trailer fee being applied to the load. If Freightvana is invoiced for                the 
incorrect amount, the invoice will be short-paid.
        • 
Carrier is responsible for any tolls incurred while in possession of FreightVana Trailer. Any tolls that are billed back to 
          FreightVana will be charged to carrier.
